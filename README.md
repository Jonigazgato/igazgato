Helping immigrants and gypsies in Europe
I have been living in Europe for 40 years.
There is a very big problem with integration here.
I am originally from the Caribbean.
I would like to be of help to immigrants and also to the Gypsies, who have been 
in Europe for centuries and still did not integrate into the society
